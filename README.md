## How to play and some details:

Control the snake with the arrow buttons on the keyboard. The length of the snake increases by 1 block whenever it eats any food. The snake dies when it gets hit by itself. Each apple gives 4 points and pizza which spawns at a set score gives 30 points. When the pizza spawns, if the player's snake eats apple first the pizza gets destroyed. This may seem like a bad design but it's intensional, it forces the player to risk for the pizza first. To make it a bit challenging, the snake also speeds up slightly whenever it eats any food.
